0. Theoretical results are presented in ```main_text.pdf```. The raw data is stored in ```../TransportationNetworks-master/```. The name of the networks corresponding to the name of the subfolders. When add new networks data (from https://github.com/bstabler/TransportationNetworks), please re-run ```Create_OMX_matrix_for_data.ipynb```)

1. To re-plot the available results (that are reported in the paper), use ```Plotting.ipynb```.

2. To generate a new instance, use ```Passing_data_to_gpickle.ipynb```. New instances, after generated, are stored in ```./data/```.

3. To re-run the experiments, use ```Main experiments.ipynb``` (by loading the instance that was generated by Passing_data_to_gpickle.ipynb). The results of the experiments are stored in ```./solutions/```.
